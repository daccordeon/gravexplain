webcam notes:
- image entire screen, capturing geometry
- likely poor image quality or resolution at low end, not designed as a scientific instrument
- need to learn OpenCV to process video feed in python
- huge variability in price, would prefer to purchace cheap initially

SM05PD2A (photodiode, mentioned)
ThorLabs

photodiode notes:
- sensitivity likely far higher than intensity from off-the-shelf webcam
- only recieves at one location, so can't infer from geometry
- watch out for shipping location, we don't want to wait weeks
- again huge variability in price

conclusion:
- try out a cheap webcam, assess how easy it is to convert data-stream to readable data
- ask an experimenter or electrical engineer for advice on photodiodes before buying any
- also need to find piezo to input frequency
