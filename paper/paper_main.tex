\begin{abstract}
Gravitational-wave observatories around the world are searching for continuous waves: persistent signals from spinning neutron stars. 
These searches use sophisticated statistical techniques to look for weak signals in noisy data. 
In this paper, we demonstrate these techniques using a table-top model gravitational-wave detector (a Michelson interferometer), where sound is used as an analogue for  gravitational waves. 
Using signal processing techniques from continuous-wave searches we demonstrate the recovery of tones with constant and wandering frequencies. 
Finally we use the interferometer as an `optical microphone' to capture music and speech and apply filtering techniques to recover the original signals from the noisy data. Such techniques include simple bandpass filtering, notch filters, a Weiner filter, and the statistical logMMSE method.  
Simple chords and drums are easily recovered, but complex music and speech are more challenging. 
This demonstration has scope for use in physics and electrical engineering undergraduate laboratories. 
It can also be adapted for use as an engagement tool for communicating gravitational-wave and signal-processing topics to non-specialist audiences.
