The original version did not work as the numbering for equations, figures, etc., where repeated between the two pdfs. I've tried to solve this by adding "S" in front of the numbers. I had to switch to an article document class for the supplementary material to make this work. I think things look okay now, but please let me know if you spot any problems! - Hannah
