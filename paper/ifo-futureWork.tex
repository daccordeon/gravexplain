The optical microphone experiment described here can be used to demonstrate and teach a variety of topics, including basic optics and photodiode circuits, to signals processing and speech enhancement. Here, we consider further extensions and improvements to the experiment such as noise isolation, transfer function analysis, speech recognition, and control systems.



Isolating the experiment from interference may provide some noise reduction. 
For example, the Raspberry Pi could be powered with a commercial battery instead of mains power. 
All other components of the circuit draw power from the Pi, so this would isolate the circuit from the mains. 
The laser is DC powered through a converter, so should not couple noise from the mains into the interferometer. 
Transferring the circuit from a breadboard to a printed circuit board can also reduce interference~\cite{elfekey2013design}.
A feedback loop control system can also be used to suppress any unwanted movement of the interferometer components~\citep{abbott2017exploring, Sekiguchi:2016bmv, verhoeven2009robust}, similar to methods used to isolate gravitational-wave observatories.

A thorough characterization of the system's transfer function would allow us to understand how audio signals couple through the interferometer. 
The total transfer function starts with the voltage being sent to the speaker and ends with the voltage recorded by the Pi. It also would include any inherent non-linearities in the speaker, the speaker-mirror coupling, the path length to intensity relation (Appendix~\ref{app:intensity_derivation}), and the photodiode. The schematic in Fig.~\ref{fig:pipeline_highlighted} shows the abstract signal flow through the system.

%With perfect knowledge of the transfer function, signal recovery is limited by the signal-to-noise ratio as an optimal matched filter could be constructed.

A voluminous literature exists on using hidden Markov models trained on phonemes to recognize speech~\cite{HMM_english}. These could perform the final stage of speech enhancement for the optical microphone. Interestingly, this coincidently connects back to the Viterbi algorithm in Section~\ref{sec:viterbi_wandering}, which is also underpinned by a hidden Markov model, albeit of a different type. Alternatively, machine learning solutions exist throughout the field that can compete with statistical techniques such as the logMMSE estimator~\cite{SEGAN}.


We could also use more traditional techniques such as wavelet transform (WT) \citep{nason1995stationary} to extract the signal from noise, and compare these with the above methods. WT provides both time and frequency information, making it easier to pinpoint the origin of noise with respect to time. In Refs.~\cite{tufekci2000feature,agbinya1996discrete}, WT methods are proposed for speech recognition. 

Returning to the demonstration of continuous gravitational-wave analysis, further extensions could include analysing data from multiple interferometers to extract directional information for audio signals. 
This would require coupling from a separate noise source instead of from a speaker attached directly to one of the mirrors of the interferometer.
