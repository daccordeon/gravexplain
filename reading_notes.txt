gravitational waves:
standard explanation -> "ripples in 4d spacetime"
quadrapole moment is why interferometers are at right angles
-> one arm stretches while the other arm squishes

coherent -> same phase
monochromatic -> same frequency
collimated -> same trajectory angle (some deviation produces the cone)

michelson interferometer
best source so far (better than the lab manual):
MICHELSONâ€™S INTERFEROMETER
https://www.niser.ac.in/sps/sites/default/files/basic_page/Michelson%20Interferometer_P744%20-%20Optics.pdf
Mirror M1 and the virtual image of mirror M2 act as the two surfaces of an air film
The fringes formed in Michelson interferometer may be circular, curved or straight depending upon the nature of the air film
-> thin film interference!

caution: phase change picked up from going through the beam splitter of non-unity (!=1) refractive index
-> not an issue for monochromatic light? so no need for compensating plane

concentric circular fringes are ultimately by the same principle as circular diffraction (airy patterns)

separation between the mirrors, d
optical path difference, pd = 2*d = n*lambda, for counting change of n fringes (normal incidence at centre, theta=0)
recall that lambda/2 is the distance from peak to trough
counting change of n fringes is past some point, watch the lines come in or go out


framerates:
standard film -> 24 fps (i.e. 24 Hz)
webcam max -> 30 fps, running usually at 15 fps

frame rate is ? (can't find listed on thorlabs site)

taking 20 fps as our ballpark, how does that limit the input frequency?
well, nyquist sampling would say that perfect recovery is possible for sounds of 10 fps or slower
however, 20 Hz is a very deep bass and is at the limit of human hearing (likely unachievable by tiny speaker)
human speech is in the range of 100 Hz
maybe piezo-electric can move at 20 Hz, but the "bug the room with the interferometer" plan is not possible
piezo resonance is around 2 kHz, sounds unlikely to work
displacement isn't an issue, piezo scale can be well below millimeters (source?)
solved! AC voltage source hooked up to piezo is successful (however annoyingly only curved fringes shown)

alternatively, photodiodes have a framerate of kHz which could capture speech/music just fine (maybe missing the high channels)
however, the photodiode restricts the source to the center, missing the airy pattern and the movement of the fringes
a photodiode array would be ideal here, however it may be an expense not necessary, testing is required


continuous gravitational wave sources:
signal is faint but present for a long period of time
poses problem as all-sky surveys (no known position or frequency) over long stretches of time produce a lot of data
unable to just fourier transform because we don't know the position on the sky of the source, so Earth's motion imprints
nearby lumpy neutron stars are candidates for continuous wave sources
potential lumpiness from surface geometry (e.g. mountains) or precession about the axis
nearby candidate in Scorpius X-1, which has non-axisymmetric asymmetry (off rotation axis lumps) from accretion
data analysis using hidden markov model + side-band + viterbi algorithm search method (which is what exactly?)
neither observing run 1 nor 2 found any gravitational radiation to 5% confidence
what's the next step? more computing time, next gen detectors?

confusion, why any gravitational waves at all?
consider a test mass in a uniform solid body rotating about its axis
it is known that this system does *not* produce gravitational waves
consider a test mass in one of a tidally-locked symmetry binary system
it is known that this system does produce gravitational waves
however, in each case the test mass only executes uniform circular motion
so, how does the test mass known when to produce gravitational waves?
are gravitational waves the superposition of waves created from all components of the system?
if we need the whole system's inertia etc. to calculate, where is the system boundary?
