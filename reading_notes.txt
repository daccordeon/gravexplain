gravitational waves:
standard explanation -> "ripples in 4d spacetime"
quadrapole moment is why interferometers are at right angles
-> one arm stretches while the other arm squishes

coherent -> same phase
monochromatic -> same frequency
collimated -> same trajectory angle (some deviation produces the cone)

best source so far (better than the lab manual):
MICHELSONâ€™S INTERFEROMETER

Mirror M1 and the virtual image of mirror M2 act as the two surfaces of an air film
The fringes formed in Michelson interferometer may be circular, curved or straight depending upon the nature of the air film
-> thin film interference!

caution: phase change picked up from going through the beam splitter of non-unity (!=1) refractive index
-> not an issue for monochromatic light? so no need for compensating plane

concentric circular fringes are ultimately by the same principle as circular diffraction (airy patterns)

separation between the mirrors, d
optical path difference, pd = 2*d = n*lambda, for counting change of n fringes (normal incidence at centre, theta=0)
recall that lambda/2 is the distance from peak to trough
counting change of n fringes is past some point, watch the lines come in or go out


framerates:
standard film -> 24 fps (i.e. 24 Hz)
webcam max -> 30 fps, running usually at 15 fps

taking 20 fps as our ballpark, how does that limit the input frequency?
well, nyquist sampling would say that perfect recovery is possible for sounds of 10 fps or slower
however, 20 Hz is a very deep bass and is at the limit of human hearing (likely unachievable by tiny speaker)
maybe piezo-electric can move at 20 Hz, but the "bug the room with the interferometer" plan is not possible
piezo resonance is around 2 kHz, sounds unlikely to work
displacement isn't an issue, piezo scale can be well below millimeters (source?)
solved! AC voltage source hooked up to piezo is successful (however annoyingly only curved fringes shown)

continuous wave sources:
look at lumpy neutron stars that produce weak but continuous gravitational waves
nearby candidate in Scorpius X-1, using hidden markov model + side-band search method (which is what exactly?)
effectively, neither observing run 1 nor 2 found any gravitational radiation (waves in the data)
